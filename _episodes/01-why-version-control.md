### Why is version control useful for researchers?

* It allows you keep track of your work and take snapshots on the important steps.
* It works as a backup.
* It can be used for versioning your source code.
* It can be used for versioning your datasets (particularily useful if you have data in textual format).
* It is great for versioning and collaborating on publications - in particular if you use plain text tools (LaTeX, RMarkdown, Jupyter Notebook).
* It significantly helps make your research **reproducible**.
* It allows you expand your **collaborations** with other researchers accross the world.
* It is a standard tool in the industry...in case you are thinking about switching careers.
