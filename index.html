<h2 id="general">Workshop information</h2>

<p> This hands-on workshop will provide introduction on using BitbBucket or GitHub for collborative work. Most of the material is based on the
  <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/"> Software Carpentry Git lesson</a>. This workshop is intended for anyone who
  wants to learn how to use version control  to be able to contribute to collaborative projects. No knowledge of 
  version control is required before coming to this session. However, 
  </p>

  <p>
    After taking this course you should be able to:
    * understand the purpose of using version control;
    * understand the advantages of using version control;
    * have a solid overview of what version control allows you to do;
    * fork and clone an existing repository from GitHub;
    * make new commits to the cloned repository;
    * push back your new commits;
    * contribute back your new commits to the original repository using pull requests;
    
    If the workshop is designed for a full day, we should also be able to cover:
    * understand the purpose of branching out in Git;
    * create a new branch in your cloned repository;
    * make commits in the new branch and contribute back these changes via pull requests;
    * understand the purpose and advantages of committing changes via pull requests in branches (a common workflow of contributing to software development projects hosted on GitHub).

  <h3>Git</h3>
  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.
