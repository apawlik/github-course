<h2 id="general">Workshop information</h2>

<p> This hands-on workshop will provide introduction on using GitHub for collborative work. Most of the material is based on the
  <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/"> Software Carpentry Git lesson</a>. This workshop is intended for anyone who
  wants to learn how to use GitHub - you don't need to know anything about version control before coming to this session.
  We will only learn how to use GitHub, please note that we will not cover using Git on your laptop.</p>

<div id="git"> <!-- Start of 'Git' section. GitHub browser compatability
           is given at https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/-->
  <h3>Git</h3>
  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported</a>
    web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
    or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).
  </p>
  <h3>GitHub</h3>
  <p>
    At this workshop we will only work with GitHub (not with Git on your machines).
    You will need an account at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.
    Basic GitHub accounts are free. Please create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
    Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For
    example, you may want to review these
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/">instructions
    for keeping your email address private</a> provided at GitHub.
  </p>
